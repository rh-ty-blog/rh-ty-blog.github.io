On Monday we started off the day by learning about what Red Hat is and what they do. We did some icebreakers to warm up and also listened to talks from various employees like Cathal, Ivan and Artem. They gave us a presentation on what specific job they did and how they got here, detailing their schooling experience and what their job entails. We then learned about Agile, and demonstrated our learning via a game/task were we had to build 2 specific potatos for a customer.

* Learned about what RedHat is. 
* Listened to various talks from different employees on their experience. 
* Learned about Agile and applied our learning via a task. 

Overall it was a fun and relatively easy day and I hope to learn more about IT and coding in the coming days.

On Tuesday we started learning about command scripts and how to apply/have fun with them. We used different commands such as 'mkdir new' and 'sudo dnf install cowsay' to have fun with scripting. We also had more talks from more employees about their jobs and how it links to IT. Then we created a GitHub account to log our learning. 

* Learned about Command scripts. 
* Listened to more employees talk about their job here.
