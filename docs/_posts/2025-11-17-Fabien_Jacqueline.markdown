# Red Hat Experience
This week I am participating in the **Red Hat TY module 2025**. 

### Monday
Today, I and other TY students in this year's TY programme, recieved an introduction to the course and a talk on the roles and history of Red Hat.
Throughout the day we undertook multiple team building excersises to help to get to know each other and become familliarised with the layout and facilities of the Red Hat Waterford branch.
These included a Wii sports competition, pool, chess and more. I found this a great way to interact with other poeple and I got the opportunity to talk with different members of the organisation to see what the work life of Red Hat intails.
