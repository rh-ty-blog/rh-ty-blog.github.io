# Red Hat Experience
This week I am participating in the **Red Hat TY module 2025**. 

### Monday
Today, I and other TY students in this year's TY programme, recieved an introduction to the course and a talk on the roles and history of Red Hat.
Throughout the day, we undertook multiple team building excersises to help to get to know each other and become familliarised with the layout and facilities of the Red Hat Waterford branch. These included a Wii sports competition, pool, chess and more. I found this a great way to interact with other poeple and I got the opportunity to talk with different members of the organisation to see what the work life of Red Hat intails.

### Tuesday
Our second day as part of the Red Hat TY course was more hands-on than yesterday. We first delved into the concepts of Git and GitHub as ways of sharing and developing programs and making them open source for the world to use, interact with and improve. Afterwards, we explored the basics of the Python programming language. I had already much experience with this language but I was not so familliar with using the terminal. This oppportunity allowed me to learn to use the basics of it and I think this will prove an important skill going into the future.
