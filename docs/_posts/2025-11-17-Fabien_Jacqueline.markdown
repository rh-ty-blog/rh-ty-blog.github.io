# Red Hat Experience
This week I am participating in the **Red Hat TY module 2025**. 

### Monday
Today, I and other TY students in this year's TY programme, recieved an introduction to the course and a talk on the roles and history of Red Hat.
Throughout the day, we undertook multiple team building excersises to help to get to know each other and become familliarised with the layout and facilities of the Red Hat Waterford branch. These included a Wii sports competition, pool, chess and more. I found this a great way to interact with other poeple and I got the opportunity to talk with different members of the organisation to see what the work life of Red Hat intails.

### Tuesday
Our second day as part of the Red Hat TY course was more hands-on than yesterday. We first delved into the concepts of Git and GitHub as ways of sharing and developing programs and making them open source for the world to use, interact with and improve. Afterwards, we explored the basics of the Python programming language. I had already much experience with this language but I was not so familliar with using the terminal. This oppportunity allowed me to learn to use the basics of it and I think this will prove an important skill going into the future.

### Wednesday
Wednesday, in comparison to the previous two days, was more talk-oriented. We recieved muliple talks on the history of computing, the workings of the cloud and the different carrer paths that current interns at Red Hat underwent that wound in many different ways before ening up in the organisation. I found it intriguing to discover that there are are so many varied options and pathways to navigate from job to job. We also got to dabble briefly in the Bash programming language and took a deeper look into the terminal. Finally, in small groups, we undertook an engineering project where we had to construct a brigde from paper straws and tape. This was definetly a very informative and enjoyable day and I learned much from it.
