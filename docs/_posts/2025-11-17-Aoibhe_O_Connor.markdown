## Red Hat TY Work Experience ##
### Monday, November 17th ###
My name is Aoibhe O'Connor and I am spending this week at Red Hat's Transition Year Programme.

My aim going into this experience was to gain a better understanding of what working in a software engineering company would be like. I wanted to gain some coding skills and hopefuly make an informed decision about what career path I wish to take.

On Monday morning, we all met at the reception to sign in and get our pictures taken. Going into this programme, I was the only student from my school and I was a bit nervous about meeting people who already had friends with them. We were given an introduction to all of the staff and then took a tour around the office.
The working environment was very interesting, with lots of facilities that I never expected to be available, such as a room with a pool table and a Nintendo Switch!

After making our way around the office, we took part in a Mario Kart Tournament on the Nintendo Switch. I found this experience very helpful: it allowed me to make new friends and have a fun time. 
Once the tournament was complete, some of us played an interesting card game. Playing this game made me more confident around the people I had just met and made me feel more comfortable at Red Hat

We took a lunch break for an hour and then returned to work. Anton gave us an informative presentation about agile and scrum. He taught us how to properly distribute tasks within a team, which I found to be applicable to my own life outside of Red Hat!

We split into three teams and we were all given a different task to complete with a Mr. Potato Head. Our team had to turn our Mr. Potato Head into a superhero!
Our team evenly distributed the tasks and gathered the pieces to assemble our 'Superhero Potato'. We created a storyline for him and presented our creation to the others.

Our next task was to construct a tower made only out of paper cups and tape that could withstand rocking the table or trying to blow it over. The tower we created was inspired by the pyramids and managed to stay standing.
In the end, we had to reconstruct the tower to allow our 'Superhero Potato' to stand on top of it. We successfully managed to create a stable platform for the Potato Head to stand on by adding additional cups.
This activity taught me a lot about teamwork and effective communication in a group. I really enjoyed this project and I hope to take part in more team-based activities.
