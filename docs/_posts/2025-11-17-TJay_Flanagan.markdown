# TY Work Experience at Red Hat
My Name is T-Jay Flanagan. I am a transition year student at Ardscoil Na Mara, Tramore.
I am at Red Hat for work experience this week. I am really enjoying it so far and I find it so interesting to see the type of work they do here.
I have met many new people who are also attending the work experience this week. The Mario Kart tournament we played yesterday was really fun. All the students and staff members are very friendly.
I am looking forward to the rest of my week at Red Hat.
