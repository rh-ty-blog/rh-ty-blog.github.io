Monday - I am at Red Hat for work experience this week. I am really enjoying it so far and I find it so interesting to see the type of work they do here.
I have met many new people who are also attending the work experience this week.All the students and staff members are very friendly here. The Mario Kart tournament we played today was also really fun. 
I am looking forward to the rest of my week at Red Hat.

Tuesday - It is my second day at red Hat. I really enjoyed today and I learned many new interesting things.
we started off the day with our daily stand-up and we listened to everyones thoughts and opinions from yesterday.The first thing we learned about was Github and how to use it. It is very useful as it is what I'm using to write this blog right now. We then had a short break and came back to learn about Python. I found this really interesting and I think it is very useful as it makes coding much easier and more simple, especially for beginners. We used python coding today and experimented a bit with it. We even made our own rock, paper, scissors game. The last thing we did today was look into "Crack a million passwords" and we looked into how passwords can be cracked and even leaked by changing the password with the hash function, which I find a bit crazy.

Wednesday - It is my third day at Red Hat.To start of the day, we have done our daily stand-up. From looking at our plan of the day on the whiteboard, the first thing we have today is a talk on the history of computing, which I must say I'm intrigued about. I'd say it will be great to learn about. After this, we are then going to be looking at Bash/Command Line which I am actully not too familiar with yet, so that should be enjoyable and I will give my best attempt at it. After, we will be discussing Student Life which may look into what it would potentially be like to study in the computer or software engineering field. We may get to hear about the personal experiences of those who have already went to college and studiied in this sector. The last thing we are doing today is an enginnering task which I am really looking forward to as I really enjoy engineering and I did engineering for Junior Cert, so hopefully my skills I have picked up may come in handy for this task.
