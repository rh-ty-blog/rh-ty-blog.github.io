I am at Red Hat for work experience this week. I am really enjoying it so far and I find it so interesting to see the type of work they do here.
I have met many new people who are also attending the work experience this week. The Mario Kart tournament we played was really fun. All the students and staff members are very friendly.
I am looking forward to the rest of my week at Red Hat.

Tuesday - It is my second day at red Hat. I really enjoyed today and I learned many new interesting things.
we started off the day with our daily stand-up and we listened to everyones thoughts and opinions from yesterday.The first thing we learned about was Github and how to use it. It is very useful as it is what I'm using to write this blog right now. We then had a short break and came back to learn about Python. I found this really interesting and I think it is very useful as it makes coding much easier and more simple. We used python coding today and experimented a bit with it. We even made our own rock, paper, scissors game. The last thing we did today was look into "Crack a million passwords" and we looked into how passwords can be cracked and even leaked by changing the password with the hash function.
