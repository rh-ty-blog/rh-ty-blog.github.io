My name is Kai and i go to De La Salle College, Waterford

Yesterday, (Monday 17th of Nov 25) I arrived late to Red Hat and was immediately greeted by friendly people and a
game of Mario kart which I really enjoyed.
The mood here is very casual and everyone is friends with each otherwhich is good. The work environment is modern and
seems efficient. 
I really liked the team games with Anton using AGILE and SCRUM which are interesting and efficient methods of
working in a team to achieve a specific goal or target.
The potato head and cup games were really fun.

Today , we had our daily stand up in the morning to discuss what we had done yesterday.
I setup my blog on Github and we learned about Git and github. I didn't know that it was used that much.
Github is great for a team that is working together. There is a main branch and loads of side brances.
Incorrect changes to the main branch can ruin everything so, people can create their own branches and submit pull 
requests for their stuff to be added to the main branch but it must be thoroughly reviewed by the manager.
This way, it is safe from interns who may accidentaly destroy the main branch which may not be able to be fixed.

We also learned python today which i remembered a little bit of but i learned a lot of new stuff.
i know that python is used everywhere and there is a big community for it.

Today , we have our daily stand up done.
What we will be doing today is we will be learning about the history of computing at 10 until 11 which will be interesting.
Then at 11 we will be learning about bash and command lines with Grainne and we will probably be typing stuff on our laptops 
as well.
At 12 we will discuss about Student Life . I don't really know what to expect for that.
At the end of the day, we will be doing an engineering task which sounds like some hands-on work.

James' talk about the history of computing and technology was really enjoyable . James brought us through the advances in
technology and computing from the radio and wireless all the way up to where we are now with the cloud and AI.
What i found fascinating was probably the first iphone created by Steve Jobs. He combined the internet, touchscreen and the mobile 
phone into one device. The iPhone.
We learned about Bash which is another computing language. it is interesting to compare the two language to see the 
similarities and differences
At the end of the day , we completed an engineering task in which we were split into 3 teams and the task was to build a 
rollercoaster made out of straws with a 360 loop in it.
my group made a simple circle-shaped rollercoaster . I really enjoyed the activity as we all worked together as a team using
AGILE and SCRUM to make small branches of the coaster and add it to the main one.


Thursday 20th of November 2025,
Today , we had our daily stand up in the morning discussed about what happened yesterday.
Then at 10, we had free breakfast in the canteen. It was like an extra lunch which was great.
After that , James talked to us about AI. I loved this because the activities we done were really enjoyable and I learned a lot
of new stuff. We were using NotebookLM by Google . James talked us through it and it is amazing. You have to give the ai the
content and it goes through it all in detail. You can get it to make a podcast, make quizzes and so much more. It is definately
something that I will use in the future.
After that we were with Shaun and we were looking at species of coral to train AI.
