Yesterday, (Monday 17th of Nov 25) I arrived late to Red Hat and was immediately greeted by friendly people and a
game of Mario kart which I really enjoyed.
The mood here is very casual and everyone is friends with each other which is good. The work environment is modern and
seems efficient. 
I really liked the team games with Anton using AGILE and SCRUM which are interesting and efficient methods of
working in a team to achieve a specific goal or target.
The potato head and cup games were really fun.

Tuesday 18th of November 2025,
Today , we had our daily stand up in the morning to discuss what we had done yesterday.
I setup my blog on Github and we learned about Git and github. I didn't know that it was used that much.
Github is great for a team that is working together. There is a main branch and loads of side brances.
Incorrect changes to the main branch can ruin everything so, people can create their own branches and submit pull 
requests for their stuff to be added to the main branch but it must be thoroughly reviewed by the manager.
This way, it is safe from interns who may accidentaly destroy the main branch which may not be able to be fixed.

We also learned python today which i remembered a little bit of but i learned a lot of new stuff.
i know that python is used everywhere and there is a big community for it.
