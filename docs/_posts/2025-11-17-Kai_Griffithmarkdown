**Date** 

Yesterday, (Monday 17th of Nov 25) I arrived late to Red Hat and was immediately greeted by friendly people and a
game of Mario kart which I really enjoyed.
The mood here is very casual and everyone is friends with each other which is good. The work environment is modern and
seems efficient. 
I really liked the team games with Anton using AGILE and SCRUM which are interesting and efficient methods of
working in a team to achieve a specific goal or target.
The potato head and cup games were really fun.
