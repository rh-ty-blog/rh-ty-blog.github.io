# Title 
Im not sure what to write for this to be completely honest i just dont want to leave it blank. Text seems to render the same as discord text so formatting the individual words should be simple enough, surrounding a word with a single asterisk on each side for italic, two asterisks on either side for bold, a hashtag/pound sign and a space for increased font size/title label, etcetera. Yesterday was fun, the mario kart tournament was good, the mr potato head thing was a little odd but enjoyable and the cup towers were great even if they turned into what looks like a group of cult shrines. I miss Jess. Kinda wish i could be playing the new Risk Of Rain 2 DLC but my pc is in galway, kinda cruel that theyve got images of ROR2 drones especially on the monitor at the top
