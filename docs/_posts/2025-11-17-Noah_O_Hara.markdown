# Title

Im not sure what to write for this to be completely honest i just dont want to leave it blank. Text seems to render the same as discord text so formatting the individual words should be simple enough, surrounding a word with a single asterisk on each side for italic, two asterisks on either side for bold, a hashtag/pound sign and a space for increased font size/title label, etcetera. Yesterday was fun, the mario kart tournament was good, the mr potato head thing was a little odd but enjoyable and the cup towers were great even if they turned into what looks like a group of cult shrines. Kinda wish i could be playing the new Risk Of Rain 2 DLC but my pc is in galway, kinda cruel that theyve got images of ROR2 drones especially on the monitor at the top

I enjoyed yesterday, i managed to code a deck of cards, its absolutely scuffed, essentially being a random number generator and 52 if statements in a row but it works so im quite happy with it, im looking forward to the engineering task later on at 14:00 so that should be fun

Yesterday there was a presentation on the history of cloud computing which i enjoyed, we were also taught a bit about how to code in Bash, i found it interesting to learn about the differences between Bash and Python even if i found Bash about as pleasant as bashing my head against a wall (this is the part where you laugh), we also made rollercoasters out of paper straws and tape, that was difficult but we managed to make one that didnt collapse barely. Today we had a presentation on AI, i still hate generative AI, then we did a thing on coral which was fun and lastly we had to do a presentation on Rain Gardens, we were meant to use ai but my group didnt purely out of spite towards ai.
