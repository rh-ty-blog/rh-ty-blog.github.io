When I walked into the office at first i was surprised how plain the entrance to the building was until I walked upstairs to the reception and then I was amazed by the design of the office. We then signed into the system and got stickers with all the details, we then walked into the Bolger suite where we recieved our laptops for the week and we logged in on them.After that we got an introduction to the company and what the whole business is about from one of the directors named James, I think. We then had an office tour and a few minutes break to use the bathroom or induldge in the snacck bar and fridge.
Next we had a talk about health and safety with Jen about tidyness and cleanliness.
After the H&S talk we had a mario kart tournament and a chance to use the pool room.
This gave me a chance to talk to everyone and get to know them. And then we had a talk about agile and scrum with Anton for 2 hours, we got to create a mr potato head and a tower that had to withstand a blow from Anton.

On the second day we had our regular Stand-Up meeting with Jen for half an hour. At ten o'clock we had an introduction to Github with Kate and she told us how important it is to make sure everything is correct.
At eleven we had a talk and a workshop with Linh and Noemi about coding and the use of python, I found this very interesting and enjoyable. I think Daniel was very helpful with the tasks we were given on python.
At three we had a task to crack passwords with Nigel, the task was called 'One million passwords'. I found this very challenging.
