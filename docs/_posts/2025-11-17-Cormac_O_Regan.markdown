When I walked into the office at first i was surprised how plain the entrance to the building was until I walked upstairs to the reception and then I was amazed by the design of the office. We then signed into the system and got stickers with all the details, we then walked into the Bolger suite where we recieved our laptops for the week and we logged in on them.After that we got an introduction to the company and what the whole business is about from one of the directors named James, I think. We then had an office tour and a few minutes break to use the bathroom or induldge in the snacck bar and fridge.
Next we had a talk about health and safety with Jen about tidyness and cleanliness.
After the H&S talk we had a mario kart tournament and a chance to use the pool room.
This gave me a chance to talk to everyone and get to know them. And then we had a talk about agile and scrum with Anton for 2 hours, we got to create a mr potato head and a tower that had to withstand a blow from Anton.

On the second day we had our regular Stand-Up meeting with Jen for half an hour. At ten o'clock we had an introduction to Github with Kate and she told us how important it is to make sure everything is correct. We created a blog about our week on it.
At eleven we had a talk and a workshop with Linh and Noemi about coding and the use of python, I found this very interesting and enjoyable. I think Daniel was very helpful with the tasks we were given on python.
At three we had a task to crack passwords with Nigel, the task was called 'One million passwords'. I found this very challenging.

Starting off on the third day we arrived a bit late due to road works at Carroll's Cross with a very heavy traffic backlog. I think we had only just missed the end of the morning Stand-up. After the Stand-up we had a very interesting talk with James about the 'History of Computing' ,it was mostly about the evolution of data storage, the web and then at the end he introduced us into some of the career's that align with the software sector. Then we had a workshop with Grainne and the use of Bash. We used Bash for roughly over an hour, I thought Bash was much more challenging then Nano and Python, I'm not too sure why to be totally honest. Once we finished this workshop we had our lunch from 1-2 where me and Aedan played pool and as usual ate the supplied pot noodles this time the flavour mushroom, I did not enjoy this what so ever. After lunch we had an engineering project to create a rollercoaster that consisted of a 360 degree loop and it also had to be made out of paper straws, all we had to create it was scissors, sellotape and the paper straws. I really enjoyed this assignment and thought it was a very good team-building because it led to me actaully talking to people and getting to know them.

On the fourth day we arrived slightly late once again due to the same traffic jam at the road works in Carrol's Cross. When we arrived in Fabian was introducing some of his coding work to the group. Shortly after we arrived there was an office breakfast that happens every Thursday, the breakfast included sausages, fried eggs, rashers, jambons, hash browns, sausage rolls and bread rolls. After the breakfast we had a very interesting talk about AI and the use of it. He showed us a very useful tool called Notebooklm that creates an audio and a brief out of ur given text or documents. We created a podcast out of all our diary'sfrom the week so far. We then had a talk about the pollution that's happening to sea coral and we used this website that helps them understand which species are which. We then had lunch for an hour whereme and a few of the other lads played Mario Kart and talked about life (very deep I know). When we came back from lunch we had to split into groups and make a presentation about rain gardens, my partner was Fabian. We then made the presentation where we all give or take had the same presentation. We then had time to work on this blog and then went home.
