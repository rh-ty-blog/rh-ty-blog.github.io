The first thing that went on was we got an introduction to the company and what the whole business is about.
Next we had a talk about health and safety after we had our office tour.
After the H&S talk we had a mario kart tournament and a chance to use the pool room.
This gave me a chance to talk to everyone and get to know them. And then we had a talk about agile and scrum with Anton for 2 hours, we got to create a mr potato head and a tower that had to withstand a blow from Anton.

On the second day we had our regular Stand-Up meeting with Jen for half an hour. At ten o'clock we had an introduction to Github with Kate and she told us how important it is to make sure everything is correct.
At eleven we had a talk and a workshop with Linh and Noemi about coding and the use of python, I found this very interesting and enjoyable. I think Daniel was very helpful with the tasks we were given on python.
At three we had a task to crack passwords with Nigel, the task was called 'One million passwords'. I found this very challenging.
