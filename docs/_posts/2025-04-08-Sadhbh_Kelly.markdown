## Tuesday

Went up to offices at 9:30 
Mark gave us laptops as we weren't here yesterday. Showed us how to open up the terminal and type in instructions like pwd and cd. The keypad on mine doesn't work so Mark gve me a mouse for it.
Met Neri and Casper and they talked about their jobs and studies. 
Got an introduction to Bash script and tried coding games Mark found on ChatGPT. None of them were really any good but they were fun for a few minute. There was on that was  bit like the dino game on Google.
Got a presentation from Jamie and Sonal on their jobs at Red Hat. Sounded very stressful... 
Lookd at github and how to fork and make changes, then set up our own accounts.
Had lunch break then
Updated blog

## Wednesday
We arrived into the office at about half 9 and came up to Red Hat. We started by sending a pr to mark from terminal but mine just wouldn't work so 3 people came down to look at my laptop and eventually Mark solved it so I could send him a pull request. Then Cathal, Mark's collegue, came to get us to do a team building exercise. I was in a group with Art and I think the other guys name was Sean... We had to make a rollercoaster with 2 loops in it, using tin foil, straws, wooden skers, tape ad rubber bands. We used a bouncy ball as the cart. We didn't do any planning and just jumped straight into it, which is proabaly why we didn't do very well. We spent about 2 hours building and managed to get the ball to go down the track and up half way of the loop de loop but that was as far as it got. Needless to say we didn't win. After that we went on lunch break and when we came back we did another team building exercise but this time we could choose our groups so I went with Mia and Amy. We had to make a presentation about Rain Gadens and we used chatgpt and canva then to present. After we had listened to everyones presentation we finished up for the day and went home.

**This is the text area where you can enter your blog details for Thursday**.
So we began the day by updating our blog again and sending a pull request to Mark. Then we had lots of people come to chat to us about their jobs. We had a man whos name I have forgotten but he talked about the different job oppertunities within Red hat. He gave me a ruler at the end for asking a question so that was nice. Then Casper chatted about his journey and told us about his rocky leaving cert and finally Fortune spoke about his journey and education. I love the name fortune I've never heard of anyone called that before.
