# Tuesday
 we did a lot learning we leared about python and nano and diffrent languages, we learned a few commands then after practice made our own rock paper sissors game it was very intresting.
 After that we went cracking passwords on a website using python its cool seeing what you can do with it. Look forward to working tommorow.
After the coading and doing all the ifs elif other and #... and ("..")   we get free time the snack bar is great and coffe machine but it burns the mouth off me
There pool room is sick its very cosy but there are people there a lot and its free the odd time
I realise being here the amount of time these people work and the free time they have.
My dad has worked in IT for about 20 years and it influenst me a lot on what i would like to do I would be looking at computer science and engeniering in collage.
There is also a billion of interns in this building .
IT is a good job to have its very intresting and u might as well have a job u like
