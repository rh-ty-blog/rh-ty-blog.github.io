hello yesterday was my first day at red hat, we all signed in and took pictures of our faces which was nice.
i got to meet new poeple and make new friends, we played a few games together and i think that really got us out of our shells 
**what i enjoyed the most**
i enjoyed playing go cart with everyone, the friendly competition was funny.
*i lost*
