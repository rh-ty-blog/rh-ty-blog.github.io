***What We Did Today***

- Today was my first day in RedHat. I spent the day getting to know people and my way around. 
 - The first thing I did today was sign into RedHat. After that we set up the computers that we would be working on for the rest of the day.All the TYs then got a tour of the campus. We then had a health and safety talk. After the health a safety talk it was game time! We started off the games by having a Mario Cart Tournament (wich I did not win). We also played pol and card games. Then it as lunch.
