***What We Did Today***

- Today was my first day in RedHat. I spent the day getting to know people and my way around. 
 - The first thing I did today was sign into RedHat. After that we set up the computers that we would be working on for the rest of the day.All the TYs then got a tour of the campus. We then had a health and safety talk. After the health a safety talk it was game time! We started off the games by having a Mario Cart Tournament (wich I did not win). We also played pol and card games. Then we had lunch.
- After lunch we had are first workshop, which ws agile. In the workshop we worked in teams to create a poatao head suitable for different activities. In my group our potato head had to be fit for space. We then made a tower of cups.

***What We Did Today***

- The first thing we did today was the daily stand-up. We talked about the pervious day and gave an update on how we were doing.
- We had two workshops today which were Github and Python. On Github we created our little blog. In the python workshop we learnt the fundamentals of coding using pyton. We did a rock, paper scissors challenge. I liked working with python as I had never orked with it before, so it was something new for me.
- After lunch we did the "Crack a million passwords" chalenge. I found this challenge really difficult and I struggled to get the basics of it. But after completing a few of the tasks I got to grips with it. I was very proud of myself as I was able to complete the challenge.
