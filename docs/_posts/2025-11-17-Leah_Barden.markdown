***What We Did Today***

- Today was my first day in RedHat. I spent the day getting to know people and my way around. 
 - The first thing I did today was sign into RedHat. After that we set up the computers that we would be working on for the rest of the day.All the TYs then got a tour of the campus. We then had a health and safety talk. After the health a safety talk it was game time! We started off the games by having a Mario Cart Tournament (wich I did not win). We also played pol and card games. Then we had lunch.
- After lunch we had are first workshop, which ws agile. In the workshop we worked in teams to create a poatao head suitable for different activities. In my group our potato head had to be fit for space. We then made a tower of cups.

***What I Learnt Today***

1. I learnt what agile organisation is
2. I learnt what scrum is.
3. I learnt what RedHat is and the sevices it offers.

***My Favourite Part of the Day***

- My favourite part of the day was getting to play the games. Playing the games allowed me to get to know both the other TYs in the programme and the staff that works at RedHat

***What We Did Today***

- The first thing we did today was the daily stand-up. We talked about the pervious day and gave an update on how we were doing.
- We had two workshops today which were Github and Python. On Github we created our little blog. In the python workshop we learnt the fundamentals of coding using pyton. We did a rock, paper scissors challenge. I liked working with python as I had never orked with it before, so it was something new for me.
- After lunch we did the "Crack a million passwords" chalenge. I found this challenge really difficult and I struggled to get the basics of it. But after completing a few of the tasks I got to grips with it. I was very proud of myself as I was able to complete the challenge.

2. I learnt the fundamentals of python, and completed a rock, paper scissors challenge.

***What We Did Today***

- The first thing we did today was the daily stand-up. We then had the "History of Computers" talk. I loved this talk becuase I found it every interesting. History is one of my favourite subjects in school so seeing it in a computers context was very interesting. In the talk I also liked how James talked about all the different types of careers in IT. It showed that there really is something there for everyone.
- After that we had a workshop on Bash coding. So far this has been my favourite coding workshop. I thought it was explained very well, and I understood what I was doing.
- The most interesting part of the day was the "Student Life" talk. I found it really eye-opening to see that studying IT is a second career for most of the interns. This really helped me not worry so much about the future.
- Our challenge today was a roller coaster building challenge. I found this challenge stressful. In the end my group found out that we had completed the challenge incorrectly. It was a great learning experience, and I enjoyed working with my group.

***What I Learnt Today***
1. The history of computers
2. Bash coding
3. All different jobs

***My Favourite Part of the Day***
My favourite part of the day was "The History of Computers" talk. I found this talk really interesting becuase as I said before I love history so this talk was right up my street. It was so interesing and also imformative. It showed me that there is a lot of different carrers in IT. I will defenitely be researching some of the careers that were mentioned.
