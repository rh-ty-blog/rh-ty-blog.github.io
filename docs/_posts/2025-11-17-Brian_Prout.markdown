## Red Hat Work Experience
---
My name is Brian. I am 17 years old and am in 5th year at Ardscoil Na Mara. I live in Butlerstown in the countryside. I am doing TY work eperience at Red Hat because I skipped TY, so I asked Ms. Lonergan if I could and she agreed. I am enjoying my time here so far, since I bet evrybody at mario kart.
