# My Blog

My name is Grace McCartan. I am 16 years old and I go to Ardscoil na Mara in Tramore. I heard about this program through a friend of my dad's. 
Yesterday (17th November) was my first day of work experience at **Red Hat**
+ First I got signed in as a guest
+ Then I signed into my laptop
+ I went on a tour of the office and the canteen
  >I learned that you are ***not*** allowed to climb on the tables
+ After this we had a Mario Kart Tournament
  >I did not win but I *did* get special mention for telling people how to play
+ Then I played a card game with the others
  > It was very fun
+ After this I had lunch.
+ After that we learned about Agile and Scrum, which are teamwork models. Following this we made a Mr Potatohead. He was a cowboy
+ Then I went home

## Today (18th November) I will:
- Learn how to make and edit this blog better
> :3
- Learn some Python
> I really liked this
- Eat lunch
- More Python
- Crack a million passwords (hyperbole?)
> Sort of, since my computer didn't have the time to process all the names

## Today (19th November) I will:
- Learn about the history of computing
  > Very interesting, learned about patterns in the development of new technology
- Learn about Bash and Command Line
  > Learned how to use commands to do things on the computer easily
- Learn about student life
  > Maybe don't look for a career in arts

We also made rollercoasters out of straws and tape. Our group did ok (nobody fully fulfilled the brief)

## On the 20th (Thursday), I:
- We had breakfast in the company, which was very nice
- We learned about AI, specifically NotebookLM, which is interesting because unlike ChatGPT, *you* provide the source material
- After that, we worked on the Coral Reef Consensus project, which asks volunteers to go online and identify corals from images. This data is used to train an AI that will identify the corals faster than a person could once it is trained.
- After that, we had to make a presentation about Rain Gardens, which I think went well
