# My Blog

Yesterday (17th November) was my first day of work experience at **Red Hat**
+ First I got signed in as a guest
+ Then I signed into my laptop
+ I went on a tour of the office and the canteen
  >I learned that you are ***not*** allowed to climb on the tables
+ After this we had a Mario Kart Tournament
  >I did not win but I *did* get special mention for telling people how to play
+ Then I played a card game with the others
  > It was very fun
+ After this I had lunch.
+ After that we learned about Agile and Scrum, which are teamwork models. Following this we made a Mr Potatohead. He was a cowboy
+ Then I went home
